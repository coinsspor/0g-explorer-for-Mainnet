### Tweet 13 (Lessons Learned)
```
📚 LESSONS LEARNED

1. Start with solid architecture (microservices = 🔥)
2. Cache aggressively, invalidate smartly
3. Multiple RPC endpoints are essential
4. Testing on mainnet early saves headaches
5. Documentation while building (not after!)

Building in public = better product! 🛠️
